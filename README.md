# Gravity Monitor for Beer Brewing

![GravityMon Logo](src_docs/source/images/gravitymon_logo_s.png)

GravityMon is a replacement firmware for the iSpindle firmware. It's 100% compatible with the iSpindle hardware design so it does not require any hardware changes. From v1.2 you can also use GravityMon for the DIY Floaty Hardware with ESP32 Lite.  

Now also works with ESP32 d1 mini, ESP32 c3 mini, ESP32 S2 mini, ESP32 S3 mini which are pin compatible with ESP8266.

Installation can be made using https://www.brewflasher.com or the web version at https://web.brewflasher.com
