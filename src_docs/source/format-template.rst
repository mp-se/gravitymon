Format Templates
################

To reduce the need for adding custom endpoints for various services there is an built in format editor that allows the user to customize the format being sent to the push target. 

.. warning::

   If format templates are large this feature can be slow on a small device such as the esp8266. 


You enter the format data in the text field and the preview button will show an example on what the 
output would look like. If the data cannot be formatted in json it will just be displayed as a text.

You can also select a template from the list and copy that to the current endpoint. 

.. tip::

   If you save a blank string the default template will be loaded.

.. tip::

   When selecting preview any json format will be verified and parsing errors will be shown. Applies to HTTP Post and MQTT.


These are the format keys available for use in the format.
