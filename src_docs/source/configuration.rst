Configuration
#############

In the ``measurement mode`` the UI is not enabled and the device will go into deep sleep once the sensors has 
been read and data has been transmitted.

The device can operate in modes and must be in ``configuration mode`` in order for the web 
server to be active. The device (esp) LED will flash slowly or show blue color when the device 
is in ``configuration mode``. 

If the LED is constant or show white color then the device is in ``wifi setup mode`` where access is done through 
the Access Point provided by the software. It can also be triggered when pressing the reset button multiple times. 
This mode is only used for configuring the wifi settings since sensors are not active in this mode. It can also 
be used as a failsafe mode if the sensors cause startup issues.

One of the following conditions will place the device in ``configuration mode``:

- Gyro has not been calibrated (Only applies to the MPU6050/MPU6500)
- Configuration mode has been forced in the web user interface on main page.
- The TX/RX pins are connected which will force the device into configuration mode.
- Placed in horizontal mode 85-90 degrees on gyro
- Battery shows >4.15V or the value that is configured (This does not work on the Floaty variant due to lack of hardware support)
- Battery shows below 2V

.. tip::

  The easiest way to enter configuration mode is to place the device on a flat surface and press the 
  reset button once. 


Home page 
=========

URL: (http://gravmon.local)

  :alt: Home page

Configuration is accessed by entering the URL for the device, this will be the mDNS name *device.local* or the IP address. The following chapter assumes the device name is *gravmon*.

If the device is not fully configured or there are some hardware issues then these will be visible on the main page. If there are things to adress this will
be indicated in the meny using a red dot.

The main page shows the device readings; gravity, angle, temperature and battery charge. If the checkbox is active then the device will never go into sleep mode. This is useful if 
you are collecting angle/tilt for calibration. If this is unchecked the device will change mode as explained before.

You can also view the average time a gravity measurement takes. Under optimal setting this should be around 1.5 - 2.0 seconds. If this is higher than 2 seconds this is most likely connected to slow wifi 
connection. It will show 0 if data has not been collected yet.

.. tip::

   If you are connected to the device via a serial console (speed: 115200) you can see the connection sequence and get the Unique ID and IP address from there.

  :alt: Device Settings

* **MDNS:** 

  This is unique name for the device. It will be used in pushing data as well as mDNS name on the network (<name>.local). 
  The limitation is 63 chars but using long names might break endpoints that data is sent to if they have other limitations. 

* **Temperature format:** 

  Choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit when displaying temperature. 

* **Gravity format:**

  Gravity format can be either `SG` or `Plato`. The device will use SG Internally and convert to Plato when displaying or sending data.

* **OTA URL:**

  Should point to a URL where the firmware.bin file + version.json file are located. For an ESP32 target the firmware should be named firmware32.bin.

  For the OTA to work, place the following files (version.json + firmware.bin) at the location that you pointed out in OTA URL. If the version number in the json file is newer than in the 
  code the update will be done during startup.

  If you have the previx `https://` then the device will use secure transfer without CA validation.

  Example; OTA URL (don't forget trailing dash), the name of the file should be firmware.bin

  .. code-block::

    http://192.168.1.1/firmware/gravmon/
    https://192.168.1.1/firmware/gravmon/


* **Dark Mode:**

  Switches the UI between light and dark mode. You can also use the toggle on the menubar for that.

* **Enable flash logging:**

  If disabled there will be no runtime logging on every run, this will prolong the lifespan of the device. 

* **Factory default**

  This function will reset all settings to factory default. Use with caution!

* **Restart**

  Restarts the device, similar to pressing the reset button


Device - Hardware
+++++++++++++++++

.. image:: images/ui-device-hardware.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Device Hardware

* **Voltage factor:**

  Factor used to calculate the battery voltage. If you get a too low/high voltage you can adjust this value.

* **Config voltage:**

  Defines the level of voltage when the device should enter config mode due to charging. This might vary between different battery manufacturers. 
  If you don't what the device to go into configuration mode when charging, set this to 6V. This was added since different batteries have different 
  voltages when fully charged. 

* **Storage sleep**

  When place on the cap (<5 degree tilt) the device will go into deep sleep forever (until reset). In order to wake it 
  up you need to do a reset. One option is to attach a magnetic reed switch (default open) to the reset pin and use a 
  magnet to force a reset without opening the tube. The reed switch is typically an electronic component of 14 mm 
  long encapsulated in a small glass tube. See hardware section for more information, :ref:`hardware`.

* **Battery saving:**

  If this option is checked the sleep interval will be changed to 1 hour when battery drops below 20%. Default = on. This setting is set to off for Floaty builds.

* **DS18B20 Resolution:**

  Define the resolution used on the temp sensor. 9 bits is default and will give an accuracy of 0.5C and and provide longest batterylife. See data below from the datasheet.

  - 9 bits = 0.5°C, up to 93 ms reading
  - 10 bits =0.25°C, up to 187 ms reading
  - 11 bits = 0.125°C, up to 375 ms reading
  - 12 bits = 0.0625°C, up to 850 ms reading

* **Temperature sensor adjustment:**

  This value will be added to the temperature reading (negative value will reduce temperature reading). This is applied
  when the device starts. So changing this will not take affect until the device is restarted.

* **Gyro Temperature:**

  Enable this feature will use the temp sensor i the gyro instead of the DS18B20, the benefit is shorter run time and
  longer battery life (this is an experimental feature). The value used is the first temperature reading from when the 
  device is activated, since the gyro should be cool this is reflecting the surrounding temperature. After it has 
  been running the value would be totally off.  

* **Calibration values:** 

  These are calibration data for the gyro. Place the device flat on a table and press the button to save the default orientation values. Without this calibration we cannot calculate the correct angle/tilt.

  .. warning::

    The device will **not** go into `gravity monitoring` mode unless calibrated

  :alt: Device Hardware (ICM)

When using a the ICM gyro the hardware page looks a little different since there is no calibration option and gyro settings. 

* **Swap X and Y axis:** 

  When enabled this option will use the Y axis for the tilt calculation instead of the X axis. The ICM development boards uses this orientation.


Device - WIFI
+++++++++++++

.. image:: images/ui-device-wifi.png

* **Password #1:**

  Enter the primary password. 

* **SSID #2:**

  Select the desired secondary SSID to use (optional). 

* **Password #2:**

  Enter the secondary password (optional). 

* **Portal timeout:**

  If the wifi portal is triggered (can be triggered by tapping the reset button 2-3 times within 3 seconds) then this is the amount of time allowed before it exists again.

* **Connect timeout:**

  This is the amount of time allowed for a wifi connect. 
   

Gravity

* **Temperature adjust gravity:**

  Will apply a temperature calibration formula to the gravity as a second step after gravity has been calculated. It's also possible to 
  build this into the gravity formula.

  .. warning::

    This formula assumes that the calibration has been done at 20°C / 68°F.

    Formula used in temperature correction. The calibration temperature can be changed under advanced settings. 

  ::

    gravity*((1.00130346-0.000134722124*temp+0.00000204052596*temp^2-0.00000000232820948*temp^3)/
    (1.00130346-0.000134722124*cal+0.00000204052596*cal^2-0.00000000232820948*cal^3))

* **Gravity calibration temp**

  This option allows you to set the correction temperature used in the automatic temperature gravity adjustment formula. Standard is 20C. 

* **Ignore low angles:**

  If this option is checked any angles below that of SG 1 will be discarded as invalid and never sent to any server. Default = off.

* **Gyro reads:**

  This defines how many gyro reads will be done before an angle is calculated. More reads will give better accuracy and also allow detection of 
  movement. Too many reads will take time and affect battery life. 50 takes about 800 ms to execute.

* **Gyro moving threshold:**

  This is the max amount of deviation allowed for a stable reading. 


Gravity - Formula
+++++++++++++++++

.. image:: images/ui-gravity-formula.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Gravity Formula

* **Gravity formula:**

  Gravity formula is syntax is the same as in the iSpindle, but the formula needs to be in SG since this is the internal format used. When choosing plato 
  the SG value will be converted and presented as Plato. On this page to create the formula by supplying the raw data. If you use the internal formula
  creator then you can enter data in plato and conversion will be handled in the device, the output formula will always be in SG.

  The gravity formula accepts two parameters, **tilt** for the angle or **temp** for temperature (temperature inserted into the formula 
  will be in celsius). I would recommend to use the formula calculation feature instead since this is much easier.

* **Data for gravity calculation:**

  Enter your gravity data SG + Angle. You can enter up to 20 datapoints. Order does not matter and values with zero as angle will be ignored.

* **Max allowed deviation:**

  This is the maximum deviation on the formula allowed for it to be accepted. Once the formula has been derived it will be validated against the supplied 
  data and of the deviation on any point is bigger the formula will be rejected. Example for SG can be 0.02 points or 0.5 for Plato. Setting a higher values
  will allow you to see more options.

* **Calculate formula:**

  When you submit the values the device will create formulas for order 1 to 4 and show those that are within the accepted deviation. You can also see 
  how the formula performs in relation to your datapoints and what the deviation is per angle. The more data points you have the better the graph.

Push targets
============

Push - Settings
+++++++++++++++

.. image:: images/ui-push-settings.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Push Settings

* **Token 1:**

  The token is included in the iSpindle JSON format and will be used for both HTTP targets. If you 
  need to have 2 different tokens you can customize the data format. 

* **Token 2:**

  The token is included in the default format for the HTTP GET url but can be used for any of the formats. 
  For HTTP GET use can use this for an authorization token with ubidots api. 

* **Sleep Interval:** 

  This defines how long the device should be sleeping between the readings when in `gravity monitoring` mode. You will also see 
  the values in minutes/seconds to easier set the interval. 900s is a recommended interval.  The sleep interval can 
  be set between 10 - 3600 seconds (60 minutes). 

  .. note::

    A low value such as 30s will give a lifespan of 1-2 weeks and 300s (5 min) would last for 3+ weeks. This assumes that 
    there is good wifi connection that takes less than 1s to reconnect. Poor wifi connection is the main reason for battery drain. 
    The device will show the estimated lifespan based on the average connection time, if no data exist it will not be shown.

* **WIFI Direct SSID:** 

  This WIFI SSID will be used during gravity mode to send data to the GravityMon Gateway.

* **WIFI Direct Password:** 

  This WIFI Password will be used during gravity mode to send data to the GravityMon Gateway.

* **Use WIFI Direct in gravity mode:** 

  Enabling this feature will disable all other push target settings and data will be sent to the gateway in a pre-defined format (iSpindle format) when in `gravity monitoring` mode.

* **Estimated battery life:** 

  Based on the hardware and the historical execution time the device will estimate how long it can run on a full battery
  with the current interval.

* **Push timeout:** 

  How long the device will wait for a connection accept from the remote service.
