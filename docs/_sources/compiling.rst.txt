Compiling the software
######################

Tools
=====
I use the following tools in order to build and manage the software:

* Visual Studio Code
* PlatformIO
* Git for Windows
* Python3 (for building docs)

.. note::

  From v2 the User Interface is built in VueJS and stored in a separate project (mp-se/gravitymon-ui). The github build 
  scripts will automatically fetch the latest version from that repository.


Code Formatting
===============
I use pre-commit and their cpp style checks to validate the code. Plugin defintions are found in **.pre-commit-config.yaml**

`Pre-Commit <https://www.pre-commit.com>`_

.. note::

  There is not yet any automatic checks since this does not work on Windows. It works if running under WSL2 
  with Ubuntu or on MacOS.


Targets 
=======
In the platformio config there are 3 targets defined

* gravity-debug; Maximum logging for trouble shooting, deep sleep is disabled.
* gravity-release; Standard release
* gravity32-release: Version for ESP32 mini.
* gravity32c3-release: Version for ESP32 C3 mini v2.1+.
* gravity32c3v1-release: Version for ESP32 C3 mini v1.0.
* gravity32s2-release: Version for ESP32 S2 mini.
* gravity32s3-release: Version for ESP32 S3 mini.
* gravity32lite-release: Version for ESP32 lite (Floaty hardware).

.. warning::
  The debug target can be unstable and crash the device under certain circumstanses. Excessive logging to the 
  serial port can cause corruption and crashes. So only enable enough debugging to troubleshoot your changes.

Serial debugging on battery
===========================

  :alt: Serial output

On the ESP32 builds the serial output can be  written to UART0 which is connected to the RX/TX pins on the chip. This way the serial output can be viewed 
without a connection to the USB port, convinient when running the device on battery power. In order to get this to work you need to compile the sofware 
with the option **DUSE_SERIAL_PINS** and attach as USB to TTL cable to the correct pins. 

You connect the USB to TTL cable that you connect the TX, RX and GND pins. **Dont connect the power pin** if you are powering the device from USB or Battery.

Source structure 
================
.. list-table:: Directory structure
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - path
     - content
   * - /.github
     - Automated github action workflows
   * - /bin
     - Contains compiled binaries
   * - /data
     - Directory for flashing device filesystem
   * - /doc
     - Various external documents used as input
   * - /html
     - Copy of gravitymon-ui (User Interface) build
   * - /lib
     - External libraries used when compiling
   * - /script
     - Scripts used in build process
   * - /src
     - Source code for software
   * - /src_docs
     - Source code for documentation
   * - /test
     - Test data for developing html files


Options 
=======
This is a list of C++ defines that is used to enable/disable functions in the code.

.. list-table:: Defines
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - define
     - description
   * - USER_SSID
     - If defined the device will always use this SSID
   * - USER_SSID_PWD
     - Password to the SSID
   * - LOG_LEVEL
     - Defines the logging level used 4=INFO, 5=DEBUG, 6=VERBOSE
   * - CFG_APPVER
     - Defines the version of the compiled software
   * - CFG_GITREV
     - Contains the last 6 digits of the git revision
   * - USE_SERIAL_PINS
     - Will send the serial console to the TX/RX pins on an ESP32 target so that debugging can be done when on battery
   * - FLOATY
     - Build for the ESP32lite FLOATY hardware option (no DS18B20 and no battery monitor)
   * - ENABLE_REMOTE_UI_DEVELOPMENT
     - When enabled this will enable the UI project to interact with a device without any security issues, should not be enabled for production builds
   * - SKIP_SLEEPMODE
     - The device never goes into sleep mode, useful when developing
   * - COLLECT_PERFDATA
     - Used to send performance data to an influx database for analysis (development)
